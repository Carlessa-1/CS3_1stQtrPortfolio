# Q1 End of Lessons Reflections

## ====================================

# Topics I understood
## 1. Logic Operators
 - Logic operators were honestly my favorite lesson since they carried my 1st long test grade. 
I didn't understand them at first until Sir Roy mentioned truth tables, then my brain locked in and I understood everything.

## 2. Arithmetic Operators
- This was my second favorite lesson since it was the easiest. I really enjoyed the exercises given to us based on this lesson.

## 3. Variable declaration
- Very easy, very logical, and very simple. My first lesson actually related to the basics of coding.

## 4. If Else statements
- These were pretty fun since they were a step up from operators but they weren't too complicated. I will forever love if else statements. 

## 5. Loop Control Structures (break, continue, Nested Loop)
- Very basic and very useful. Nested loops are the best.

# Topics I didn't understand that well
## 1. Loop Control Structures (in general)
- I get the basic foundation of each type of loop but when it comes to having to apply them practically I'm just lost. I'm glad I started off with for loops since they seem the most efficient. I think I just need more practical exercises showing me what to do then another one where I have to do it myself.

## 2. While loops
- I get the basic gist of them, I guess I just get confused from time to time since inputting the statements doesn't seem that intuitive for me. I just need to practice and play around with them more.

## 3. For loops
- Same as while loops, I get the basic gist but I find it hard to apply them practically. Graded exercise 6 was especially hard for me since I was really lost. I just need to practice more to get better.

## 4. Printing shapes
- At first I thought they were pretty basic, but I'm still a bit lost when it comes to printing shapes with spaces before them. I think I just need more hands on practice with it.

## 5. Functions
- I get how to initialize them, but sometimes I get really confused on how to practically apply them. Despite that, functions are more intuitive to me compared to loops, they're my favorite thing to play around with in VScode.

## ====================================

# What will I do to understand them?
- Since I'm a new transferee I have to work double time to catch up to my peers, to understand these topics better I'll make sure to study CS topics at home and read the given lessons/slides in Khub. Working on my own projects with JS, HTML, and CSS will definitely help out a lot too.

# Effective exercises done in class
## Effective:
#### 1. Code debugging
- It probably would've been really helpful for me if I knew half the stuff going on. I kind of just prayed and hoped stuff would work. This is probably just a me problem since I have no prior knowledge in coding at all. (LOL)

#### 2. Coding exercises in class
- Very helpful especially since I can always ask the GOAT (Sir Roy) questions in case I get lost. I get live explanations as to why that thing works or why we do that so I get to learn a lot. :D


## Not Effective:
Honestly I can't think of anything we did in class that was inefficient or ineffective to our learning process, so I can't put anything in this section. Most of the activities and examples we covered in class helped me learn more about JavaScript and are reflected in my scores. We never wasted time during CS and it was always spent on something useful.
 (Sir Roy is just the GOAT)
